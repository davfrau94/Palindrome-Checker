# Palindrome Checker

This is a simple web application built as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification on [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
The project is an interactive **Palindrome Checker** that evaluates whether a given input string is a palindrome, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## 📚 What is a Palindrome?

A **palindrome** is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards.  
Examples include:

- `"racecar"`
- `"A man, a plan, a canal. Panama"`
- `"No 'x' in Nixon"`

This app will detect those, even when there are special characters or mixed case letters.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- String manipulation with `.replace()`, `.toLowerCase()`, `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()`
- DOM manipulation with `getElementById()` and `addEventListener()`
- Input validation and basic user feedback
